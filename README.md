## General Information
- Problem Statement:
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, is facing revenue challenges due to the pandemic. To revive business, they aim to predict demand for shared bikes post-lockdown. The goal is to identify key variables influencing demand, assess their impact, and create a model for understanding demand variations based on features. The insights will guide business strategy adjustments and help BoomBikes meet customer expectations in the evolving market conditions.
Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusions
1 Final Observations :
As per our final Model, the top 3 predictor variables that influences the bike booking are:

Temperature (temp) - A coefficient value of ‘‘0.5043’ indicated that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by ‘0.5043 units.

windspeed: A coefficient value of ‘-0.1794’ is a negative values; indicated that, a unit increase in windspeed variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.1794 units.

Year (yr) - A coefficient value of ‘0.2394’ indicated that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.2394 units.

So, it's suggested to consider these variables utmost importance while planning, to achive maximum Booking

The next best features that can also be considered are

season_winter: A coefficient value of ‘0.0734’ indicated that, a unit increase in winter variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.0734 units. People prefer to wait until the are not that high or extremly cold.

weathersit_moderate: A coefficient value of ‘-0.0680’ indicated that, a unit increase in variable, decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.0680 units.

mnth_sep: A coefficient value of ‘0.0648’ indicated that, a unit increase in mnth_sep variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.0648 units. Mostly climate in September with plenty of warm sunshine and clear blue skies for most of the month. September is a great month to have road trips as they balance the weather between warm and cold.
